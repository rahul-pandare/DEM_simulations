# DEM Simulations

**Analysis of Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations with two contact models: Cundall-Strack and Hertz-Mindlin**

This repository contains code and data for DEM simulations comparing two widely used contact models:

### üìÅ Repository Contents

### üìå Notes

- The simulation is implemented in **Python** and is intended for educational and research purposes.
- The report highlights differences in how each model handles normal and tangential contact forces, stiffness, and damping effects.
